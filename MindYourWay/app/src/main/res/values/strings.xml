    <string name="tutorial">Mind Your Way is a game where you visit checkpoints around the map.\nFrom the main city view different region can be seen, separated by outlines. Tap on a region to select it. At the start only the Center region is unlocked, but as you progress you will unlock more!\nOnce you press \"Go to this region\", you will see the checkpoints represented by differently colored circles: [img src=btncirclew/], [img src=btncirclex/]. Select one that is available, but not reached yet, and press \"Go to location\". This will open a Google Maps screen where you can view your position [img src=ic_gps/] and  your destination [img src=ic_dest/]. When you reach your destination, press [img src=ic_reached/] to proceed to the next stage.\nNow you can play a minigame! After finishing it, the checkpoint will be marked as complete.\nComplete more checkpoints to earn experience and level up!</string>
